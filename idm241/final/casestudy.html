<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>For my IDM 241 class, I created interactive and engaging microinteractions for around the layout for Pinterest, incorporated my skills of using HTML, CSS, and Javascript from previous classes. </p>
<p>In this class, we learned to recognize and develop elements of microinteractions to create a holistic digital experience.</p>

<h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
<p>Spanning 10 weeks, from September to December 2024, this solo project allowed me to showcase not only my technical and design skills, but also my creative problem solving abilities.</p>
<p>The challenge lay in identifying minor details of the digital experience, from hovering enlarged icons to color switches on clicks.</p>

<h2>Process and Insight</h2>
<h3>Design and Planning:</h3>
<p>I began the project by seeking design inspiration and creating layouts in Figma. The goal was to establish a modern and approachable aesthetic, with vibrant colors and typography that added a fun and inviting feel. The branding was kept short and impactful, and I prioritized responsive design to ensure the siteâ€™s usability across different devices.</p>

<h3>Database Organization:</h3>
<p>Once the design was finalized, I created prototpes of the interactions</p>

<p>In the area of interaction design, I slowly incorporated more objects and ways to interact with them as the weeks progressed. Beyond showing my progress through code every 2 weeks, I made sure to explain the expectations for my microinteractions by clearly listing the triggers, rules, feedback, loops & modes for them.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>The final design brought together a series of thoughtful microinteractions that make the original portfolio more dynamic and engaging.</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>In the end, I was able to create a responsive and fully fledged digital experience of the Pinterest interactions.</p>
